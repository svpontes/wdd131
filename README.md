******************Instructions for Week 1*********************
Setup: Hosting on GitHub
Overview
The purpose of this setup activity is to establish a remote repository that will render and serve web pages to clients. This class uses the GitHub platform to host your course work and the GitHub Pages service to render your work as a normal, client requested website.

GitHub Official Logo
GitHub is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration. GitHub offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git, and has its own features.

Activity Instructions
A GitHub account is required. If you already have a GitHub account, use it. Your account on GitHub can host many repositories/projects.
You do NOT need a separate GitHub account for this class.
In your GitHub account, create a repository named "wdd131" (without the quotes). This will be your course repository. Be sure to use lowercase notation as shown.

Verify that you have Git installed on your computer. You can check the status of git by using a command line interface and typing
git --version
If you do not have git installed, go to Git-Installing Git and follow the directions for your operating system.
Verify that your git global username and email are configured on your local system.
git config --list
Git Configuration
Set the git configuration file to NOT ignore case changes/renaming in file and folder names.
git config --global core.ignorecase false
Clone the repository to your local system. Your local repository folder is your working repository from which you will build, test, edit, commit and then finally, deploy/upload when you are ready.

Publishing Process: Open the repository folder in VS Code and test that you can make additions/changes, commit those changes, and push (upload) to your wdd131 remote GitHub Pages repository for public.
